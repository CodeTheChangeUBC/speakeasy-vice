<ol type="1">
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Peer dialogue</li>
  <li>Mentoring</li>
</ol>

<p>
With these tools, you will be better equipped to find your balance with alcohol, drug, or technology use in your life. This website has a wide range of information, resources, and tips that you can look through to explore what kind of balance you have with alcohol, drugs, and technology.
</p>

<p> As well as education, Vice provides peer dialogue sessions and a mentoring program. </p>

<p> If you are interested in engaging in dialogue about alcohol, drugs, or technology, we encourage you to drop by one of our weekly sessions. These sessions are great for students interested in exploring these concepts out of curiosity, to shift their own substance use patterns, or to learn more to be able to assist a friend going through this process. Anyone is welcome to come!  To learn more about these sessions click <a href="http://www.ams.ubc.ca/services/vice/services/dialogue-sessions"> here </a>. </p>

<p> If you feel like you have been struggling on your own to shift your substance use patterns, and could use some peer support to help guide you along the way, you should check out our mentoring program. This program connects you with a peer that is well versed in the particular area that you are struggling with and will help you come up with a plan to get you back to a balance that you’re happy with. After meeting with your mentor once, you can choose to stay for the full program, which lasts one month. If you’re unsure if the mentoring program is right for you, you can check out a dialogue session first to start engaging in a discussion around these topics. </p>
