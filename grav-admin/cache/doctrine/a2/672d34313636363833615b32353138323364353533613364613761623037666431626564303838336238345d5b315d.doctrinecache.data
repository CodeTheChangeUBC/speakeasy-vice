<p> The three tools that Vice provides are education, peer dialogue, and mentoring. With these tools, you will be better equipped to find your balance with alcohol, drug, or technology use in your life. This website has a wide range of information, resources, and tips that you can look through to explore what kind of balance you have with alcohol, drugs, and technology. </p>

<p> As well as education, Vice provides peer dialogue sessions and a mentoring program. </p>

<p> If you feel like you have been struggling on your own to shift your substance use patterns, and could use some peer support to help guide you along the way, you should check out our mentoring program. This program connects you with a peer that is well versed in the particular area that you are struggling with and will help you come up with a plan to get you back to a balance that you’re happy with. After meeting with your mentor once, you can choose to stay for the full program, which lasts one month. If you’re unsure if the mentoring program is right for you, you can check out a dialogue session first to start engaging in a discussion around these topics. </p>
