<h3 class="h3">MENTORSHIP</h3>
<p>For those who would like personalized support, VICE provides a one-on-one mentorship program. A student will be paired with a mentor, who they will collaborate with to determine a course of action, then check in once a week for a month to support their progress, address obstacles, identify “red flags”, make plans, and connect them with community resources. Specific goals will be tailored to each student, in order to make sure the student is ultimately comfortable and happy with the choices that they’re making.</p>
<p>Our volunteers complete training dealing with drugs and alcohol, mainly, but are also available to support students dealing with the problematic use of tech, gambling, sex, porn, and other vices.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact vice@ams.ubc.ca with any questions.</p>
<p>Students interested in the program can fill out a short application. Information provided (other than contact info) is optional, and will never be shared outside of AMS Vice: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/CbNr25bMBq32Ozmm2">Google Form</a></p>
