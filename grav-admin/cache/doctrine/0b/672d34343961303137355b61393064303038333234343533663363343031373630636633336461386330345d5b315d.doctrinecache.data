<ul>
<li>VICE has also teamed up with Kaleidoscope to provide group peer support sessions. These are open to anyone who's navigating substance use, addiction, dependence, problematic use, sobriety, and those who are curious about making a change. We all have a unique relationship to our "vices" (substance-based or otherwise), and we'd like to provide a space for you to discuss, connect, and find support.</li>
<li>Visit: <a href="http://the-kaleidoscope.com/social-contract/">Kaleidoscope</a> to read our group guidelines.</li>
<li>Meetings are informal, and usually begin with a “check-in”, where attendees talk about their recent struggles and successes. We allow the conversations to develop organically to allow for honest and open discussions around often unspoken topics.</li>
<li>These take place every second Wednesday in the Nest, 6-7PM. Join us in Nest 2508 (South-West corner) on October 4th &amp; 18th, and November 1st, 15th, &amp; 29th!</li>
