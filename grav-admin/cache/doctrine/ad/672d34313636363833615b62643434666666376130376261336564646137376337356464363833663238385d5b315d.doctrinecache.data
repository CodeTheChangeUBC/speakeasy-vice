<p> Speakeasy provides free, confidential, one-on-one peer support for UBC students and staff facing a wide variety of challenges. </p>

<p> University can be an extremely challenging and stressful time for anyone. Speakeasy provides a safe space of non-judgment and acceptance for students and faculty members who need support. </p>

<p> We can also connect you with many other resources that may be helpful for the issues you are facing. If you need help and are not sure exactly where to turn, Speakeasy is a great first option to get you started! </p>

<p> We all have relationships with our own mental health, so weâ€™re committed to increasing awareness of mental health issues and reducing the stigma associated with them. Our team of dedicated Marketing Outreach volunteers is out on the campus every week to let people know about our service and contribute to discussions about mental health! </p>
