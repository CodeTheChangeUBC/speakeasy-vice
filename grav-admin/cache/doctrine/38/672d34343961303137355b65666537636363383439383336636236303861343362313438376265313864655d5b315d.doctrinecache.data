<p>Life by itself can be quite a handful. Throw university on top of that and things can get pretty stressful.</p>
<p>AMS Speakeasy is a <strong>FREE</strong> service that provides confidential, one on one peer support for UBC students and staff! At Speakeasy, we provide a safe space of non-judgement and acceptance for those in need of support. Furthermore, we can also provide you with additional resources and referrals both on and off UBC Campus that you may find helpful with the issues you may be facing.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re feeling lost and unsure of where to go, Speakeasy is a great first stepping stone that can help you pointed in the right direction!</p>
<p>Our volunteers are trained extensively before and during the school year to ensure that anyone who accesses the service receives the best support possible.</p>
