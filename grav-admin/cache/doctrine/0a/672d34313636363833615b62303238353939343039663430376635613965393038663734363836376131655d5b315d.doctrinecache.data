		<p>
			To make use of this great service, come by the Speakeasy reception desk on the main floor of the AMS Nest, across from Merit Travel (room 1314). You can also drop by our office in the Services Wing of the AMS Nest (room 3107L). All drop-in sessions are very strictly confidential and held in a private setting.<br> We chose our Peer Support Volunteers extremely carefully, and we provide them with extensive training to support students with a wide variety of issues. Our goal is to empower you to resolve issues in your own way by providing support, information and guidance.
