<h2 class="w-sub-title">  AMS VICE hosts naloxone training party  </h2>


<p class="w-body">
Using naloxone to save lives

During a drug overdose, the high abundance of opioids affecting a user’s brain reduces their urge to breathe. If breathing ceases, this can fatally deprive their brain of oxygen. However, when naloxone is administered, it knocks the opioids off of their brain receptors for about 30 to 90 minutes. This can restore breathing in less than a minute and completely resume normal breathing in two to five minutes.

If someone is overdosing, the speakers instructed the audience to call 911 and follow the steps in the SAVE ME protocol — check if they’re responsive, open their airways, provide ventilation via a breathing mask, evaluate the situation to see if more needs to be done, inject one millilitre of naloxone into a muscle, then evaluate the situation and apply more breaths and naloxone if they’re not responsive.

After the presentation, the attendees were taught how to properly use naloxone. Using syringes and ampules filled with saline, they got to practice administering the drug by injecting it into oranges and stuffed animals. Naloxone kits were also given out at the end of the event.
