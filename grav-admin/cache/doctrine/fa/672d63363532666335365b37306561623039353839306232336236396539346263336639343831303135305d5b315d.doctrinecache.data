<h4> Peer Support </h4>
<p>
To make use of this great service, come by the Speakeasy reception desk on the main floor of the AMS Nest, across from Merit Travel (room 1314). You can also drop by our office in the Services Wing of the AMS Nest (room 3107L). All drop-in sessions are very strictly confidential and held in a private setting.
<br>
We chose our Peer Support Volunteers extremely carefully, and we provide them with extensive training to support students with a wide variety of issues. Our goal is to empower you to resolve issues in your own way by providing support, information and guidance.
</p>


<h4> Campus Outreach </h4>
<p> We all have relationships with our own mental health, so weâ€™re committed to increasing awareness of mental health issues and reducing the stigma associated with them. Our team of dedicated Marketing Outreach volunteers is out on the campus every week to let people know about our service and contribute to discussions about mental health! </p>
