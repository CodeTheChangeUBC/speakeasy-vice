So you’ve heard us ramble on and on about wellness now and hopefully the term Self Care is not new to you. If this is the first term you’ve heard about self care, then here is a simple explanation.

Self care is pretty much what it sounds like. It’s doing something that can help take your mind of current stressors and give you a breather so you can take a step back and look at a situation or issue more clearly in the future.

Let’s get one thing out of the way. Some of you may have heard people preaching about self care and wellness by suggesting that meditation is the solution to everything or learning how to handle stress is the only way. **This isn’t always the case**. Self care will look different for everyone. Some people will find solace in meditation but others won’t. Health and Wellness, like many things in life, isn’t binary. There are so many things to consider when trying to sort of one’s issues.
The following is a list of self care activities that you may find helpful. Once again, do note that the efficacy of these activities will vary between individuals. As much as we’d like to say we could give you a magic exercise that would make it go away, we can’t.
So before you read our list, try to keep the following in mind!

+ Everyone is different and so when choosing an activity, think of doing one that you might enjoy or think relates well to your own personality
	- For example: if you find yourself fairly outdoorsy, perhaps going for walks will be more effective than reading a book.
+ Activities aren’t an instantaneous fix. Some of these activities will require some commitment overtime before you may see some effect. Activities such as breathing exercises usually are more effective after spending at least a month working on the daily.
+ Don’t get discouraged! As we mentioned earlier, wellness is an active process of learning what works best for you! You may be a little disheartened when you find that some self care activities aren’t going your way, but if you stick it out until the end, it will make victory taste that much sweeter.
