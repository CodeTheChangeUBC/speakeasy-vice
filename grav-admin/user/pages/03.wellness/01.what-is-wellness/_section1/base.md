When talking about mental health, wellness is likely going to be one of the words that comes to your mind. But what does it really refer to?

### DEFINITION OF WELLNESS {.h3}
Well, it’s a hard question to answer simply because it is so broad. We understand that everyone’s needs for different types of wellness will vary but since this website is aimed primarily at students, we’ll break down wellness into eight different categories based on their potential relevance to you!

1. Emotional
	- Includes understanding your own feelings and emotional state and how they can influence your ability to effectively cope with the stresses of life.
2. Social
	- Relates to how you thrive in a social setting in an effective and comfortable manner and thus allowing you to create a strong support network.
3. Physical
	- Maintaining a healthy body and seeking the necessary care when needed. This includes getting enough sleep and eating well.
4. Spiritual
	- Relates to adopting a set of values that can aid you in seeking meaning and purpose within your life.
5. Intellectual
	- Relates to keeping an open mind when you encounter new ideas and showing a willingness to expand one’s knowledge.
6. Financial
	- Regards one’s ability to maintain their finances successfully.
7. Occupational
	- Occupational wellness relates to enjoying the occupational aspects of your life and appreciating your own contributions.
8. Environmental
	- Living a lifestyle that is respectful to the Earth as well as protecting it.

As you can see, some of these dimensions overlap with one another. In fact, all these dimensions are related. Each of dimension is equally important because they support each other in helping you achieve your optimum level of wellness.
