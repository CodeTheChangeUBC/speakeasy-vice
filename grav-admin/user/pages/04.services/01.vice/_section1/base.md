AMS VICE exists to support students in navigating addictive substances and behaviours, whether you decide to achieve abstinence or reduce harm with alcohol, drugs, tech, or some other vice. We don't judge, moralize, or prescribe; instead, we aim to empower students and equip them with tips and tools towards healthier patterns of use!

The tools that VICE provides are education, peer dialogue, and mentorship.
