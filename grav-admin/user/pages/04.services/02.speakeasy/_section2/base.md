### ACCESSING THE SERVICE {.h3}
Accessing the service can be done through multiple avenues. They have been listed in order of speed of seeing a volunteer.

1. **Going directly to the Speakeasy Reception Desk**
	- Accessing the service is as simple as going to the Speakeasy reception desk on the main floor of the AMS Nest which is directly across Merit Travel (Room 1314). Once there, just request for a drop in session.
2. **Going to the Speakeasy Office**
	- If you feel uncomfortable or otherwise do not want to directly approach the desk, feel free to come by the Speakeasy Office located on the 3rd floor of the AMS Nest (Room 3107) and we can accompany you to the desk.
3. **Calling or emailing the Coordinators**
